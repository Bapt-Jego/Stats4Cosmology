# Stats4Cosmology

A curated collection of **Jupyter notebooks** introducing and applying statistical 
methods to problems in **cosmology**.  

The aim of this repository is to provide practical, hands-on examples for students 
and researchers who want to learn how to use statistics in the context of cosmological 
data analysis, model comparison, and forecasting.
